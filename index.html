                <h2>Ontario Digital Education Platform</h2>
                <h3>Ministry of Education | Toronto, ON</h3>
                <h5>Sept 2024 - Apr 2025</h5>
                <p>
                    This artifact is the Ontario Digital Education Platform where teachers and students can access their curriculums digitally. It was launched in June 2020, accessed by over 1 million users annually, and aims to be user-centric and inclusive. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During my time with the ministry, I performed manual functionality, performance and security testing across multiple environments for two separate releases (Release 13 and Release 14), while adhering to Agile methodology. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For Release 13, my main focus was AODA WCAG 2.1 compliance. In addition, I performed rigorous testing on the search pages, resources pages, and another note-taking feature, which was later discontinued indefinitely.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Release 14 introduces a new search feature showcased on the homepage, designed to help users easily navigate and find specific subjects or curriculums! (The feature title remains undisclosed as Release 14 has yet to be launched.) 
                    <!-- While implementing this simple feature, unexpected challenges surfaced, reveavling many potential issues. These challenges required close collaboration with my QA lead, the developers and the rest of the team to further discuss user requirements and refine the approach. I conducted extensive user story analysis to uncover edge case scenarios, which helped inform development decisions. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Managing this feature required adaptability and strong organizational skills, particularly in navigating frequent bug reports, shifting resources, and a turbulent team reorganization. Fortunately, the team's Agile project management helped in collaboratively addressing evolving requirements and minimizing delays in deployment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Key skills I honed during this project include user story analysis, effective communication, and flexibility. User story analysis, in particular, became a critical asset as it prevented gaps in understanding and prevented potential blockers in implementation. This thorough, pre-development process ensured that the feature was delivered to meet business objectives and user expectations, despite the unforeseen challenges.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As of the end of my 8-month co-op term, this feature is still in progress and plans to be released before the Fall 2025 term. 
                    <br>

                <p>This is the website you're currently on. I thought 
                    this project would be a great way to learn some new skills while also showcasing my portfolio :)
                    <!--<br><br>
                    By combining my background skills and a youtube tutorial, I started by creating a draft website. When I became familiar with the language, I learned to modify my existing website to be personal to myself. 
                    <br><br>
                    It was enjoyable putting together a simple project from scratch. Now, encorporating additional creative aspects is found to be quicker with the help of Google!

                    <!-- <br><br>
                I found gathering research and reviewing topics about system functionality further enhanced my ability to put this project together. By seeking feekback on my code approach from TA's, I could complete this project with confidence. 
                    <br><br>
                Reading documentation and learning the importance of effective research was a useful skill to learn as a result of this project.

                As my first hackathon, I made some friends, learned a lot while under pressure and had some fun :)

                I designed the front-end of the application and coded the back-end of the events features. In more detail, I engineered RSVP, list view, and event display features enabling students to RSVP and admins to
                manage events effortlessly.
                    <br><br>
                This project taught me the importance of proper planning and continuous communication. By developing and effective plan results in a smooth and effective execution of user requirements.
