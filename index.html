            <p>This is some stuff about me! I'm doing a Specialist Program Computer Science at the University of Toronto Scarborough in the Software Engineering Stream. 
                I'm currently interested in CyberSecurity and working towards a SOC I certificate. In my free time you might find me crocheting, baking, or walking around exploring.

                <h2>DCP Ontario Curriculum</h2>
                <h3>MPBSDP | Toronto, ON</h3>
                <p>
                    This artifact is a reflection of my ongoing co-op experience at the Ministry of Public and Business 
                    Service Delivery and Procurement (previously the Ministry of Education). My main responsibilities include agile testing on the Ontario Curriculum website, which is accessed by over 1 million users annually. I perform manual, regression, performance, and security testing across multiple environments to ensure the website's stability. Additionally I ensure the website is AODA (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act) compliant for the website's Release 13. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To perform these tasks, I researched the role, took notes from my peerâ€™s guidance, and reviewed the work of previous co-op students to better understand my responsibilities. I also explored the website to familiarize myself with its components and functionalities. As a result, I found it easier to log bugs and became more knowledgeable about the website's features, terms, and proper functionality.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My supervisor has provided positive feedback, stating that I am making good progress. I believe this experience has improved my my problem-solving, communication, and critical thinking skills. I think my presentation skills and ability to ask insightful questions as improved as well! Looking back, I could make some improvement by not being afraid to ask questions and prepare my presentation speeches by writing it down.

                <h2>Personal Website</h2>
                <p>This is the website you're currently on. I thought 
                    this project would be a good way to learn some new skills while also showcasing my portfolio :)
                    <br><br>
                    By combining my background skills and a youtube tutorial, I started by creating a draft website. When I became more familiar with the language, I learned to modify my existing website to be more personal to myself. 
                    <br><br>
                    It was enjoyable putting together a simple project from scratch. Encorporating more creative aspects is found to be quicker with the help of Google!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Created using HTML and CSS. I'm working on my JavaScript skills
                    and aim to encorporate it into this project soon!
                </p>

                <h2>System Monitoring Tool</h2>
                <p>This is a real-time system information tool created for my Software Tools & Systems Programming course. It's created to run on a Linux OS and utilizes signals and multi-processes to improve program quailty. 
                    <br><br>
                I found gathering research and reviewing topics about system functionality further enhanced my ability to put this project together. By seeking feekback from TA's on my code approach, I could complete this project with confidence. 
                    <br><br>
                Reading documentation and learning the importance of effective research was a useful skill as a result of this project. 
                </p>

                    <br>
                    This program is made using C and Visual Studio.

                <h2>EcoGrocer</h2>
                <p>A mobile application aimed to reduce food waste in the winter season. This project prototype was built for the 2024 ElleHacks. 
                    <br><br>
                My role involved the back-end task of leveraging AI to parsing recepits and gather "online ingredients" into an online fridge to keep track of date bought and expected expiration dates.
                    <br><br>
                As my first hackathon, I made some friends, learned a lot while under pressure and had some fun :)
                </p>

                <p>
                    <br>
                    Built in a team of four, we aimed to encorportate MongoDB and Auth0 with Android Studio, but found it incompatible. Ultimately the prototype was made using Java, Android Studio, Google ML Kit and Figma.

                <h2>Student Portal Group Project</h2>
                <p>A mobile application aimed to improve the students in Computer Science, Math and Statistics department at UTSC. It was built in a team of five for my Software Design/OOP course.
                    <br><br>
                I designed the front-end of the application and coded the back-end of the events features. In more detail, I engineered RSVP, list view, and event display features enabling students to RSVP and admins to
                manage events effortlessly.
                    <br><br>
                This project taught me the importance of proper planning and continuous communication. Developing and effective plan results in a smooth and effective execution of user requirements.
